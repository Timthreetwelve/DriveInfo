The DriveInfo ReadMe file


Introduction
============

DriveInfo will display basic information about all disk drives that are in "ready" status.


Using DriveInfo
===============

You may experience a delay between when you launch the application and when the drives are displayed.
This delay is usually due to one or more of the drives being in sleep or power saving mode. Once the
drive wakes up the window will appear. There also seems to be a delay if a network drive recently
became unavailable.

All columns in the grid are sortable by clicking on the column header. Multiple columns may be sorted
by holding Shift while clicking on the column header.

Pressing F5 will refresh the display. Press F7 to toggle alternate row shading. Ctrl+C will copy the
details to the Windows clipboard.

To uninstall, use the regular Windows add/remove programs feature.
