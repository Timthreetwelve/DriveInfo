The DriveInfo ReadMe file


Introduction
============
DriveInfo will display basic information about the disk drives that are connected to a computer.


Using DriveInfo
===============
You may experience a delay between when you launch the application and when the drives are displayed.
This delay is usually due to one or more of the drives being in sleep or power saving mode. Once the
drive wakes up the window will appear. There also seems to be a delay if a network drive recently
became unavailable.

You can choose to have the disk size and free columns display in either GB (1000^3) or in GiB (1024^3).
The column headers will changes accordingly.

All columns in the grid are sortable by clicking on the column header. Multiple columns may be sorted
by holding Shift while clicking on the column header.

Pressing F5 will refresh the display. Press F7 to toggle the shading of alternate rows in the data grid.
Ctrl+C will copy the details to the Windows clipboard in tab delimited format.

In addition to the above, the menu has selections that let you include or exclude drives that are not
ready, allow the DriveInfo window to stay on top of other windows, and to make the display larger or
smaller. You can also use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to zoom the display.


Uninstalling DriveInfo
======================
To uninstall, use the regular Windows add/remove programs feature.
